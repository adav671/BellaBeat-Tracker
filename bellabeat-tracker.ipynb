After cleaning, formatting, and analyzing the data from the smart device, I have a few recommendations that can help improve Bellabeat's marketing strategy.\n\nAs a company (Bellabeat) we want to help women improve their lifestyles and assist them in creating healthier and happier lifestyles. With a smart device, it can track different components of the client's lifestyle and then interpret it to give recommendations such as: setting a bedtime or increasing steps taken incrementally throughout the day. \n\nAs a woman myself, I want the option of creating a lifestyle plan that both fits my needs and helps me out. The Bellabeat smart device could feed into the app and alert the client of potentially harmful habits (ie. increase sedentary minutes, decrease the amount of sleep per night) and create suggestions in guiding you to the right path. \n\n### Recommendations (for the app): \n\n1. Create a bedtime alert to help clients with healthy sleeping habits\n2. Alert clients who have been sedentary for a certain time to get up and walk or move \n3. Since the most active hours is between 5-7 pm. Create a friendly reminder to workout or move around that timeframe\n4. Have the client set a goal of total steps or distance to increase calories burned and decrease sedentary minutes per day\n5. Extra: Create daily competitions of steps to achieve (if a client wants/needs motivation)","metadata":{}}]}
